# [About the Project](#about-the-project)
![Screen Shot](https://mac-cdn.softpedia.com/screenshots/PyCharm-Community_43.jpg)

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects.

It can be used to build apps, website, automation and much more. It is a user-friendly script which can be used by anyone around the world üåè. The main use of python is being used for AI, Machine Learning, Automation, etc. which help us to do our work easily.


# **Built With**
We will be needing little software which will help you to build script and also your program.


# **Getting Started**
What we will be needing little software to getting started with:

1. [Python 3.xx.x]([Download Python | Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) (for Windows, Mac or Linux)
2. [Pycharm]([Download PyCharm: Python IDE for Professional Developers by JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)) (select Communication version for Windows, Mac or Linux)


## **Prerequisites**
We will be either needing any kind of devices no matter if you're an IOS user or android user.


## **Installation (Offline usage)**
1. [Python 3.xx.x]([Download Python | Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) (for Windows, Mac or Linux)
2. [Pycharm]([Download PyCharm: Python IDE for Professional Developers by JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)) (select Communication version for Windows, Mac or Linux)


# **Usage (Offline usage)**
1. After installing both the software open up.
2. First we will be creating new project with whatever name you want or just clone this repo into any directory and open it up into Pycharm.

```git
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/mrfoxie/Python-for-begineers.git Python-Tutorials
```

3. Now cd to `Python-Tutorials` and then to `Jupyter_Notebook` to execute the file.

```bash
cd ~/Python-Tutorials/Jupyter_Notebook
ls -1
```

it will give you list of all codes which are being executable.
